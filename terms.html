          Tangibly, Inc. (“Tangibly,” “we,” “us” or “our”) recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of our online visitors. It is our intent to balance our legitimate business interests in collecting and using information received from and about you with your reasonable expectations of privacy. The following privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes the way we handle information learned about you from your visits to our website available at tangibly.com (the “Site”), which includes our online, web-based applications (the “Hosted Services”).
          <br><br>
          PLEASE REVIEW THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. When you submit information to or through the Site, you consent to the collection and processing of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. By using the Site, you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use. If you do not agree with the processing of your personal information in the United States, or you do not otherwise accept this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use, please discontinue your use of the Site. 

          <br>
          Location
          Our Site is hosted in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States and are accessing our Site, your personal information as described in the Privacy Policy will be processed and stored in the United States, and the laws in the United States may not be as protective of personal information as laws in your resident country.

          <br>
          Personal Information Collected
          Tangibly collects personally identifiable information from you, which may include information you provide voluntarily to us, information we collect automatically and information that may be provided from third-party sources. 

          <br>
          1.  Information You Voluntarily Provide To Us
          In the course of using our Site, you may provide the following categories of information voluntarily to us: 

          • Contact Data, including your first and last name, email address, postal address, and phone number.

          • Document Data, including information related to the documents you upload to our Site. 
          • Business Information, including your company’s or employer’s name, title, and business address.

          • Payment Information, which may include your billing address, credit/debit card information, etc. 

          2.  Information We Collect Automatically 
          We also collect certain information automatically from you when you use our Site. This information may include the following: 

          • Site Use Data, including data about features you use, pages you visit, emails and advertisements you view, products and services you view and purchase, the time of day you browse, and your referring and exiting pages.

          • Device Data, including data about the type of device or browser you use, your device’s operating software, your internet service provider, your device’s regional and language settings, and device identifiers such as IP address and Ad Id. 

          • Location Data, including imprecise location data (such as location derived from an IP address or data that indicates a city or postal code level).

          We use various tracking technologies to automatically collect information when you use the Site, including the following:

          • Log Files, which are files that record activities on the Site and events that occur in connection with your use of the Site.    

          • Cookies, which are small data files stored on your device that act as a unique tag to identify your browser. We use two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate our website and expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies help with personalizing your experience, remembering your preferences, and supporting security features. Additionally, persistent cookies allow us to bring you advertising both on and off the Site. Persistent cookies may remain on your device for extended periods of time, and generally may be controlled through your browser settings. 

          • Pixels (also known as web beacons), which is code embedded in a website, video, email, or advertisement that sends information about your use to a server. There are various types of pixels, including image pixels (which are small graphic images) and JavaScript pixels (which contains JavaScript code). When you access a website, video, email, or advertisement that contains a pixel, the pixel may permit us or a separate entity to drop or read cookies on your browser. Pixels are used in combination with cookies to track activity by a particular browser on a particular device. We may incorporate pixels from separate entities that allow us to track our communications, bring you advertising both on and off the Site.  

          We do not have access to the contents of documents you store on our Hosted Services unless you grant us access.  Those documents are encrypted, and are decrypted only for use by an authorized user. 

          3.  Information from Third-Party Sources.
          We also collect information from third-party sources. The following are the categories of sources we collect information from: 

          • Service Providers, including third parties that provide services for Tangibly such as our online payment processors. 

          • Social networks when you engage with our content, reference our Service, or grant us permission to access information from the social networks.

          • Publicly-available sources, including data in the public domain. 

          <br>
          How Information is Used 
          We may use the information we collect for any of the following purposes:
          • to communicate with you.
          • to provide the Site, and to improve the Site;
          • to operate, improve, and personalize the products and services we offer;
          • to provide you with information about products and services that we provide that we think may be of interest to you;
          • for our own research and analysis purposes; and
          • for customer service, security, to detect fraud or illegal activities, and for archival and backup purposes in connection with the provision of the Site. 

          <br>
          Sharing of Information 
          • With Third-Party Service Providers Performing Services on Our Behalf. We share your personal information with our service providers to perform the functions for which we engage them. For example, we may use third parties to host the Site or assist us in providing functionality on the Site, process payments, provide data analysis and research on the Site, and to send out email updates related to our products and services.
          • For Legal Purposes. We also may share information we collect from users as needed to enforce our rights, protect our property or protect the rights, property or safety of others, or as needed to support external auditing, compliance and corporate governance functions. We will disclose personal information as we deem necessary to respond to a subpoena, regulation, binding order of a data protection agency, legal process, governmental request or other legal or regulatory process. We may also share personal information as required to pursue available remedies or limit damages we may sustain. 
          • Changes of Control. We may transfer information, including your personal information, in connection with a change of ownership or control by or of us or any affiliated entity (in each case whether in whole or in part).

          <br>
          Tangibly does not share your personal information with non-affiliated third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes.

          <br>
          Analytics and Advertising.
          We use analytics services, such as Google Analytics, to help us understand how users access and use the Site. In addition, we work with agencies, advertisers, ad networks, and other technology services to place ads about our products and services on other websites and services. For example, we place ads through Google,  LinkedIn and other providers that you may view on their platforms as well as on other websites and services. 

          <br>
          As part of this process, we may incorporate tracking technologies into our own Site and related services (including our emails) as well as into our ads displayed on other websites and services. Some of these tracking technologies may track your activities across time and services for purposes of associating the different devices you use, and delivering relevant ads and/or other content to you (“Interest-based Advertising”).

          <br>
          As indicated above, vendors may act as our service providers, or in certain contexts, independently decide how to process your information. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.

          <br>
          For further information on the types of tracking technologies we use on the Site and your rights and choices regarding analytics, Interest-based Advertising, please see the “Information We Collect Automatically” and “Your Rights and Choices” sections.

          <br>
          Your Rights and Choices. 

          <br>
          1.  Tracking Technology Choices.
          • Cookies and Pixels. Most browsers accept cookies by default. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to decline or delete cookies. If you use multiple browsers on your device, you will need to instruct each browser separately. Your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations. 

          • Do Not Track. Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals. Accordingly, we do not monitor or take action with respect to “Do Not Track” signals.  For more information on “Do Not Track,” visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.

          Please be aware that if you disable or remove tracking technologies some parts of the Service may not function correctly. 

          2.  Analytics and Interest-Based Advertising.
          Google provides tools to allow you to opt out of the use of certain information collected by Google Analytics at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and by Google Analytics for Display Advertising or the Google Display Network at https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/ .  

          The companies we work with to provide you with targeted ads are generally required give you the choice to opt out of receiving targeted ads. Most of these companies are participants of the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) and/or the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). To learn more about the targeted ads provided by these companies, and how to opt out of receiving certain targeted ads from them, please visit: (i) for website targeted ads from DAA participants, https://www.aboutads.info/choices; (ii) for app targeted ads from DAA participants, https://www.aboutads.info/appchoices; and (iii) for targeted ads from NAI participants, https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. Opting out only means that the selected participants should no longer deliver certain targeted ads to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., in connection with the participants’ other customers or from other technology services).

          You may also limit our use of information collected from or about your mobile device for purposes of serving targeted ads to you by going to your device settings and selecting “Limit Ad Tracking” (for iOS devices) or “Opt out of Interest-Based Ads” (for Android devices). 

          Please note that if you opt out using any of these methods, the opt out will only apply to the specific browser or device from which you opt out. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any opt out options or programs, or the accuracy of any other entities’ statements regarding their opt out options or programs.

          3.  Communications.
          You can opt-out of receiving marketing emails from us at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link provided in each message. Please note that you cannot opt-out of non-promotional emails, and that your opt-out is limited to the email address used.

          Security Used & Retention of Personal Information 
          Tangibly uses reasonable security measures designed to prevent unauthorized intrusion to the Site and the alteration, acquisition or misuse of personal information; however, we will not be responsible for loss, corruption or unauthorized acquisition or misuse of personal information that you provide through the Site that is stored by us, or for any damages resulting from such loss, corruption or unauthorized acquisition or misuse. We will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected, or as required by applicable laws or regulation. 

          Links to External Websites
          Our Site may contain links to third-party websites. Your access to and use of such websites is not governed by this Privacy Policy but is instead governed by the privacy policies of those third-party websites, and we are not responsible for the information practices of such third-party websites. 

          Children 
          We do not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from any person under the age of thirteen. No parts of our Site are directed to or designed to attract anyone under the age of thirteen. 

          California Shine the Light Law
          Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as California’s “Shine the Light” law, California residents with whom we have an established business relationship are entitled to request and receive, free of charge, once per calendar year, information about the customer information we shared, if any, with other businesses for their own direct marketing uses in the previous calendar year. To request a copy, please contact us at privacy@tangibly.com. Please be aware that not all information sharing is covered by the “Shine the Light” law requirements and only information on covered sharing will be included in our response.

          Additional Disclosures for Nevada Residents.
          Nevada law (NRS 603A.340) requires each business to establish a designated request address where Nevada consumers may submit requests directing the business not to sell certain kinds of personal information that the business has collected or will collect about the consumer. A sale under Nevada law is the exchange of personal information for monetary consideration by the business to a third party for the third party to license or sell the personal information to other third parties. If you are a Nevada consumer and wish to submit a request relating to our compliance with Nevada law, please contact us as at privacy@tangibly.com.
